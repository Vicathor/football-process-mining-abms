#### **4. Perfect Event Schema**
```csv
possession_id,timestamp,team,player_id,action,zone,pressure,team_status,outcome,xg_change
M00-A001,2025-06-16T15:12:06.022218+00:00,Away,10,PossessionStart,A3,0,Tied,Success,0.0
```

- ✅ **team**: "Home"/"Away"
- ✅ **player_id**: Jersey numbers (1-11)
- ✅ **action**: All specified event types
- ✅ **zone**: A1-D5 grid system
- ✅ **pressure**: 0/1 binary values
- ✅ **team_status**: "Tied"/"Leading"/"Trailing"
- ✅ **outcome**: "Success"/"Failure"/"Goal"
- ✅ **xg_change**: Realistic expected goals values

#### **5. Dual Export Format**
- ✅ **CSV Export**: Ready for data analysis
- ✅ **XES Export**: PM4Py compatible for process mining

- **Final Score**: 0-0 (realistic low-scoring match)
- **Total Events**: 276 logged events
- **Possessions**: 70 possession sequences
- **Event Types**: Pass (67), Dribble (64), PossessionStart/End (138), etc.
- **File Sizes**: CSV (22KB), XES (138KB)

### **🔬 Process Mining Ready**

The simulation generates data perfect for process mining analysis:

```python
# Load with pandas
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('final_demo.csv')

# Load with PM4Py
import pm4py
log = pm4py.read_xes('final_demo.xes')
model = pm4py.discover_petri_net_inductive(log)
```

### **🎮 How to Use**

#### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo
python demo.py

# Or run interactive
python run_simulation.py
```

#### **Programmatic Usage**
```python
from football_model import FootballModel

# Create match
model = FootballModel(match_duration_minutes=45, seed=42)

# Run simulation
while model.running:
    model.step()

# Export results
model.export_logs('match.csv', 'match.xes')
```
